"""HR advisory agents.

The primary advisory path is the Delegate engine (delegate/arbor_loop.py) —
a TAOD loop where the LLM decides what tools to call via 208+ registered tools.

Action agents (CalculatorAgent, DocumentGenerationAgent) are still used as
tool backends by the Delegate.

ShortTermMemory is used by the advisory router for conversation context.
